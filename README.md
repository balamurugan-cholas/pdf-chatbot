# pdf-chatbot
PDF Chatbot is a Flask-based web application that lets users interact with PDFs using AI. Admins can upload PDF files, and users can select any uploaded file to ask questions. The app extracts text using PyMuPDF (fitz) and uses Googleâ€™s Gemini 1.5 model to generate accurate, context-aware answers.
